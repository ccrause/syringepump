Changed:
* Added limt switch checks to upPopCallBack/dwnPopCallBack.
* Reloaded bootloader.
* Moved servo pin to D14 to remove chatter during programming.
* Changed "const int stPmm" to "const long stPmm" to prevent truncation of large values.
* New safeMoveTo function - use for all stepper moves since it checks limit switches and maximum stroke length.
* GUI - removed timer, text now copied to page 0 on home button release event.
* GUI - changed t5, t6 scope to global - reading diameter, stroke, dispensing rate now works correctly.
* Reads dispensing volume (potential problem if user is busy editing dispensing volume and then press dispense button). FIXED in new GUI layout.
* Dispensing button works.
* Removed stepper enable pin - pullup messed with bootup memory voltage setting.
* Servo pin directly from ESP32.
* Encoder runs from 3.3V rail.
* Stepper driver runs from 3.3V rail, directly conencted to ESP32.
* Added delay before reading hidden text - it seems that Nextion requires some time to update text after Home button clicked.
* Added trip detection by comparing stepper pulses vs. encoder pulses. Everything should stop working when tripped.  Have to reboot to reset trip.
* Settings now saved & loaded in flash - save functionality only available from Serial for now.
* Runs multiple dispense cycles if dispensing volume exceeds syringe volume.

TODO:
* Change status bar to reflect percentage of full stroke moved
* Add save config button somewhere on screen

Notes
* Should dispensing be blocked until pump has been through a priming cycle?
* Re-prime if stroke length is changed?
* Consider reading settings directly from page1 (using sendCommand).  Copying data from page1 to page0 seems like a poor hack.
